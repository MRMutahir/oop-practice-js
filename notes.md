# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, but it also supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through its class syntax.

## Part of OOP

- **Object Literal**: A simple way to create objects using `{}`.
- **Constructor**: A special method used to initialize objects.
- **Prototype**: An object that provides methods and properties to other objects.
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and methods.
- **Instances**: Specific objects created from a class using the `new` keyword.

## 4 Pillars of OOP

### 1. Abstraction

**Definition**: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features. It simplifies interaction by providing a clear interface.

**Example**: A `Car` class that hides the complexity of starting the engine.

### 2. Encapsulation

**Definition**: Bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricts access to some components. It protects the internal state of the object.

**Example**: A `BankAccount` class that hides the balance and provides methods to deposit and withdraw money.

### 3. Inheritance

**Definition**: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy between classes.

**Example**: A `Teacher` class that inherits from a `Users` class, extending its properties and methods.

### 4. Polymorphism

**Definition**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling method overriding and dynamic behavior. It enhances flexibility and method handling.

**Example**: An `Animal` class with different subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`) where each subclass provides its own implementation of the `speak` method.
